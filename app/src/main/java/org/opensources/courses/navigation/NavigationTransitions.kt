/*
 * Horizontal push between screens: the new screen slides in from the end edge while the previous one
 * slides out towards the start edge, at the same speed. Both stay fully opaque and edge to edge, so
 * what lies behind them (the window background follows the system theme, not the theme chosen in the
 * app) never shows through: no flash in any theme. Going back, predictive back gesture included,
 * plays it in reverse. Directions follow the layout direction; the system animation scale applies.
